           <h2>Game 3: Grid City</h2>
           <p class="objective">Objective:</p>
           <p class="objective-p">Seek out the story underlying the squares of this grid</p>
           <p>Unlike the megalopolis, urban planners loved the gridded city.Gridded cities even interested the historical Marco Polo, who likened gridded cities to a chessboard in <em>The Book of Ser Marco Polo</em> (375). Not surprisingly, Calvino depicts his own Kublai Khan and Marco Polo as chess players in Invisible Cities. Kublai hopes to win at chess and possess his cities, yet Polo focuses his attention on hidden narratives of the squares on the chessboard. This "overwhelm[s]" the Khan, who is amazed by Poloâ€™s ability to unearth "the quantity of things that could be read in a little piece of smooth and empty wood" (132). While the Khan is occupied with "checkmate," Polo "was already talking about ebony forests, about rafts laden with logs that come down the rivers, of docks, of women at the windows" (132).</p> 

           <p>If the gridded city is like a chessboard, can you find the stories embedded into its squares?</p>
