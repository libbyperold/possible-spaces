                 <h2>Game 1: Hidden City</h2>
                 <p class="objective">Objective:</p>
                 <p class="objective-p">Find  hidden redemptive moments in an edgeless city.</p>
                 <p>Literally meaning 'large city,' the megalopolis perturbed mid-1960s urban planners, who were examining cities so overgrown that they started to link up to one another. Calvino knew of the megalopolis, and too was concerned by "the unending, undifferentiated city which is steadily covering the surface of the earth." Even so, through the figure of Marco Polo, Calvino advocates for finding possibility within the impossible megalopolis: "if you want to know how much darkness there is around you, you must sharpen your eyes, peering at the faint lights in the distance."</p>
                 <p>In this game it is your job to find these hidden moments of possibility in the edgeless city. Embedded into an image of a megalopolis, there are square that represent 'happy' moments in the invisible cities. Can you find them?</p>
