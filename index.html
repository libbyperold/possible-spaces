						<h1>(Im)Possible Spaces</h1>
						<p id="epigraph">Architecture asks us to imagine that happiness might often have an unostentatious, unheroic character to it, that it might be found in a run of old floorboards or in a wash of morning light over a plaster wall &mdash; in undramatic, frangible scenes of beauty that move us because we are aware of the darker backdrop against which they are set.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center; padding: 0; margin: 8px auto 14px; font-size: 12px;">&mdash; Alain de Botton, The Architecture of Happiness</p>
						<p class="intro-p">In 1972, Italo Calvino published one of his most renowned works, <em>Invisible Cities</em>. Composed of fifty-five prose poems about cities both mythic and real, <em>Invisible Cities</em> centers on a continuous conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. <em>Invisible Cities</em> grounds itself in a recurring dilemma: the Khan’s empire is destined for ruin. As a result, Polo must explore “the traces of happiness still to be glimpsed” within it.</p> 
						<p class="intro-p">This project &mdash; consisting of both this website and <a href="lp-written.pdf" class="inline-link">a written piece</a> &mdash; will focus on the importance of searching for redemptive spaces. At a time when it was becoming increasingly difficult to live in cities, Calvino was steeped in a culture that was obsessed with the prophetic ‘ruin’ of the modern metropolis. <em>Invisible Cities</em> looks past the catastrophic predictions and instead reveals what makes cities possible.</p>

						<h3>Why Games?</h3>
						<p style="line-height: 20px;">As a member of the French “Oulipo” movement &mdash; short for "ouvroir de littérature potentielle" &mdash; Calvino partook in many Oulipian ‘constraint games’. (See an entire list of these constraints at <a href="http://oulipo.net/fr/contraintes" class="inline-link">Oulipo's website</a>). According to Anna Botta, for this group of French literati, “literature is not the product of an exterior romantic inspiration, but instead the intentional, painstaking creation and invention of new structures or forms from the hidden potential of our everyday language.” Each city that Polo visits in Invisible Cities is different from the last. But his 55 cities, while distinctly unique, each share an underlying logic or ‘rule’ to them. Therefore, this thesis site is not just a direct re-illustration of each of the 55 cities. Instead, it hopes to surface the ‘rules’ that tie these cities together.</p>

						<h3>Why the look?</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify; word-spacing: -2px;">I wanted the site to reflect Calvino’s self-referential, minimalistc, and whimsical style. Each illustration is my own photograph, processed through a variety of Photoshop filters to make it look more imaginative, timeless, and Calvinian. For the illustrations, I drew inspiration from <a href="http://www.davidfleck.co.uk/81919/739039/everything/invisible-cities" class="inline-link">David Fleck</a> and the photocollage style of <a href="http://www.hockneypictures.com/photos/photos_collages.php" class="inline-link">David Hockney</a>. The color palette and type headings reflect the style of three architectural movements &mdash; Spatial Urbanism, L'Architettura Radicale, and the Situationist International &mdash; specifically Guy Debord’s <a href="http://imaginarymuseum.org/LPG/Mapsitu1.htm" class="inline-link">Naked City project</a> and <a href="http://images.delcampe.com/img_large/auction/000/085/318/455_001.jpg" class="inline-link">poster designs for Mai 1968</a>. While the type headings are bold san-serifs, emblematic of book and poster aesthetics from late 20th century Paris and Italy, the monospace typeface alludes to its own medium: the screen. This font style, popularized in the late 70s and early 80s, is often associated with hackers and programmers. As Calvino’s works were highly aware of their own medium as books, so this website hopes to refer to its own space on the&nbsp;web.</p>

						<h3>Why a website?</h3>
						<p>While much of <em>Invisible Cities</em> retells Marco Polo’s fantastical adventures to unknown and intriguing cities, the majority of the book situates us in a conversation between Polo and his audience, Kublai Khan. As such, <em>Invisible Cities</em> concerns itself with questions of interaction: who tells the story? How might it be received? Does dialogue provide answers or only open up more questions? Given this self-referential contemplation on the implications of discourse, it seemed that the book was not only asking to be visualized, but also to be translated into a more dynamic, interactive medium. Even Kublai notes that in Polo’s descriptions "you could wander through them in thought, become lost, stop and enjoy the cool air, or run off" (38). This site hopes to make <em>Invisible Cities</em> conducive to that sense of wandering. Each game on this site is distinct from one another, but within every one, I too hope for you to "wander" in thought, "become lost" or&nbsp;"run&nbsp;off."</p>

						<h3>The other portion</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify; word-spacing: -2px;">Like its written counterpart, this site seeks to show how impossible spaces &mdash; or games &mdash; can still leave room for moments of delight. Because the written portion of this thesis project explores two tropes in <em>Invisible Cities</em>, the megalopolis and the labyrinth, the site thus hopes to visually evoke them through edgelessness and disorientation. The megalopolis is especially apparent in games 1 and 4, by way of the 'infinite' city and tarot cards, while games 2 and 3 speak to the ruptured, disorienting aesthetic of the labyrinth. After you finish these four games, you might notice there is no "answer key," and most of the 'objectives' are in fact impossible. This is an intentionally user-unfriendly decision. The written portion examines how Calvino does not offer answers but questions; how he doesn’t avoid 'impossible spaces' but instead draws attention to them, while allowing space for moments of possibility within them. If you should feel frustrated on this site full of impossible games, it is exactly the Calvinian experience I had hoped to translate from my written thesis. </p>
